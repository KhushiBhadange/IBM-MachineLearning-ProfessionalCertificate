Surprisingly, you can use a linear model to fit nonlinear data. A simple way to do this is to add powers of each feature as new features, then train a linear model on this extended set of features. This technique is called Polynomial Regression.\n","\n","There are two factors when determining model performance: overfitting and underfitting. Overfitting is when the model is too complex and does well on the training data but not on the test data. Underfitting is when the model is too simple and performs poorly on the training and testing data sets. \n","\n","Overfitting is simple to deal with, using methods like regularization, which we will discuss in the next lab. To deal with underfitting, we can build a more complex model using methods like polynomial regression. If making a more complex model does not work, this may involve using more data to train the model on or obtaining new features. As this process is complex, it's better to determine if the model can overfit the data first. Therefore, in this section, we will use Polynomial Regression to overfit the data to determine if we have an adequate amount of data.\n","\n","In this notebook, we will explore Polynomial Regression and perform polynomial transform using individual features as well as multiple features.\n","\n","\n","## Objectives\n","\n","After completing this lab you will be able to:\n","\n","*   Understand the concept of  overfitting versus underfitting\n","*   Apply polynomial transforms to data \n","*   Perform  hyperparameters grid search on a model, using validation data \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["***\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## **Setup**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["For this lab, we will be using the following libraries:\n"," - [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML240ENSkillsNetwork783-2023-01-01) for managing the data.\n"," - [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML240ENSkillsNetwork783-2023-01-01) for mathematical operations.\n"," - [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML240ENSkillsNetwork783-2023-01-01) for visualizing the data.\n"," - [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML240ENSkillsNetwork783-2023-01-01) for visualizing the data.\n"," - [`sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML240ENSkillsNetwork783-2023-01-01) for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.\n"," - [`scipy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/stats.html/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML240ENSkillsNetwork783-2023-01-01) for statistical computations.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## **Import the required libraries**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The following required modules are pre-installed in the Skills Network Labs environment.
